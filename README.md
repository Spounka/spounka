	<summary>👨‍💻 Nazih's Coding journey</summary>

I have started programming at the age of 14, making random scripts in Windows batch files, afterwards I
found `GameMaker` which helped me shape my desire into becoming a game developer

A year later I found myself downloading the UnityEngine and trying it out for the first time because GameMaker was not
cut for making 3D that well.

Having made countless prototypes I then jumped on to using pure C++ and OpenGL, sometimes using graphic libraries
like [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

Having acquired the most of that experience and shaped my brain to think and solve problems I shifted my attention to
web development, where I'm willing to use my found skills in solving real world issues adding my own touch to it
